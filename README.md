# Configuration Guide 

Objective: A network is defined as multiple units that are interconnected and communicate with one another. We are creating a network made up of end servers such as printers, phones, TVs, tablets,and in this configuration: PCs,laptops, and servers. The objective of this network setup is to simulate a network enviornment and configure the devices to communicate with one another and external networks. This practice involves assigning IP addresses, setting up subnet masks, and configuring hardware such as routers, switches, and DNS servers. This should help you understand network concepts and the process of transmitting data across different devices.

Cases for the System: 
 - Accessing a webpage -> When you access a webpage, 
 - Transferring a file 

- Detailed steps for setting up core system components (network devices, cloud services, security configurations)
- Screenshots or command outputs to enhance clarity
- Key configuration decisions and justifications

Use 192.168.0.0/26 and 172.16.0.0/24 as the network ranges. Pay attention to the subnet mask for each subnet.
