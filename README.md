# Configuration Guide 

Objective: A network is defined as multiple units that are interconnected and communicate with one another. We are creating a network made up of end servers such as printers, phones, TVs, tablets,and in this configuration: PCs,laptops, and servers. The objective of this network setup is to simulate a network enviornment and configure the devices to communicate with one another and external networks. This practice involves assigning IP addresses, setting up subnet masks, and configuring hardware such as routers, switches, and DNS servers. This should help you understand network concepts and the process of transmitting data across different devices.

Cases for the System: 
 - Accessing a webpage -> Computers communicate through IP addresses, therfore when you want to access a webpage, you type the domain name into google but your computer is using a DNS server to identify which IP address is configured with the webpage. The web server then responds with the webpage content. 
 - Transferring a file -> Similar to accessing a webpage, your laptop sends a request to a DNS server to find the IP Address associated with the domain name and once you have the IP Address, you can request the web server hosting the webpage.
 - Network Printing -> the user sends a print job to the network printer, once the printer on the network is identified, it transfers the print file there, last the printer receives the print file and prints it.  

Steps to Set Up a Network: 
 1) 
- Detailed steps for setting up core system components (network devices, cloud services, security configurations)
- Screenshots or command outputs to enhance clarity
- Key configuration decisions and justifications

Use 192.168.0.0/26 and 172.16.0.0/24 as the network ranges. Pay attention to the subnet mask for each subnet.
